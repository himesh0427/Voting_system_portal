## Vision
The Voting System smart contract is designed to create a secure and transparent voting process using blockchain technology. It ensures that each participant can cast a single vote and that the results are tamper-proof. The decentralized nature of the blockchain guarantees the integrity and transparency of the voting process, making it ideal for elections and other decision-making processes where trust is paramount.

## Features
- **Candidate Management**: The contract allows for the registration of multiple candidates for the election. Each candidate is identified by a unique ID and has a corresponding vote count.
- **One Voter, One Vote**: The system ensures that each voter can only cast one vote. Once a vote is cast, it cannot be changed or revoked.
- **Voting Process**: Voters can cast their vote by specifying the candidate's ID. The vote is then securely recorded on the blockchain.
- **End Voting**: Only the admin can end the voting process. Once ended, no more votes can be cast.
- **Result Announcement**: After voting ends, the contract determines the candidate with the most votes and emits an event announcing the winner.
- **Transparency**: The voting results can be viewed by anyone, ensuring transparency in the election process.

## Future Scope
- **Candidate Registration**: Implement a function to dynamically add candidates before the start of voting, allowing for a more flexible setup.
- **Enhanced Security**: Introduce more complex authentication methods to ensure only eligible voters can participate.
- **Multiple Elections**: Extend the contract to handle multiple elections simultaneously, each with its own set of candidates.
- **Voter Anonymity**: Enhance the privacy of voters by ensuring their choices remain anonymous.
- **Integration with DApps**: Build a decentralized application (DApp) to interact with the voting contract, providing a user-friendly interface for voters and administrators.
- **Multi-Admin Support**: Add support for multiple administrators to manage the election process.

## Project Structure

### Contracts
- **VotingSystem.sol**: This is the core smart contract containing all the logic for the voting process, candidate management, vote counting, and result declaration.

### Events
- **VoteCasted**: Emitted when a voter casts a vote, logging the voter's address and the candidate they voted for.
- **VotingEnded**: Emitted when the admin ends the voting process, announcing the winning candidate's ID, name, and total vote count.

### Functions
- **Constructor**: Initializes the contract with predefined candidates and sets the contract deployer as the admin.
- **vote(uint candidateId)**: Allows a voter to cast their vote for a specific candidate.
- **endVoting()**: Allows the admin to end the voting process and calculate the winner.
- **getCandidate(uint candidateId)**: Returns the name and vote count of a specific candidate.
- **getWinner()**: Returns the name of the winning candidate after the voting has ended.
